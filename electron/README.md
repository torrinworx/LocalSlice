# Packaging the App with Electron

The primary reason for using Electron is to package the app as a single executable file that can run on multiple platforms, such as Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

Automating this process involves a series of steps:

## Steps

1. **Build the React App**: Generate the static files for the React front-end.
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
  
2. **Package the FastAPI App**: Convert the FastAPI app into a standalone executable using PyInstaller.
    ```bash
    pyinstaller --onefile your_fastapi_app.py
    ```
  
3. **Integrate FastAPI Executable into Electron**: Move the generated FastAPI executable into your Electron project folder.

4. **Launch FastAPI from Electron**: Utilize Node's `child_process` module to initiate the FastAPI executable when the Electron app starts.

5. **Package Electron App**: Bundle the entire Electron app into a single executable file using utilities like `electron-packager` or `electron-builder`.

### Summary

1. Use PyInstaller to package FastAPI into an `.exe` file.
2. Use `electron-packager` or `electron-builder` to package the Electron app, which now includes the FastAPI `.exe`, into a single `.exe` file.

> **Note**: Building the app must be done on the target system (Windows for `.exe`, MacOS for `.dmg`, Linux for `.deb` or `.rpm`). This is due to different compilers being used on each system. However, the entire process is automated and designed to work on all three operating systems.
